## How to Install and Run the Project

This section is a sequential list of steps I took to get create and modify this repository.

1. Clicked `New Repository` in GitHub
   1. Named it & supplied description
   2. Checked the "Add README.md" button
   3. Added a `.gitignore` using the `Python` template, which I'd never tried before.
2. Cloned the repository to my machine using VS Code
   1. Edited this `README.md` up to this point.
3. Added `.venv` to the repository
   1. utilizing:
```shell
python3 -m venv .venv  
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip  
python3 -m pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```
1. Copied an existing `requirements.txt` file into the repo
